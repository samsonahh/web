<h1>About Me in the Pandemic</h1>

<h2>Online Activities</h2>
<p>Aside from playing volleyball every day over the summer, my friends and I also played videogames after our volleyball sessions. Team chemistry was very important in grass volleyball so we did some team bonding by playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a five vs five shooter game. This game relied heavily on teamwork and helped us build stronger friend relationships. Not only did we play FPS based games together, but we also played party games like Mario Party 9 and the Jack Box Party packs to better understand each other and have fun with each other using humor. I also spent time on my own playing a game called <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/home">osu!</a> where I could improve my hand-eye coordination and my reaction time. Additionally, my parents signed me up for a short 2-week summer program called the Fresh Air Fund where I had to spend 4 hours every day from 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM learning about camping and nature. This program offered a stipend of $500, so I agreed to it since I was mostly playing sports or games over the summer. I hopped on a zoom call to meet new people from NYC that I have never seen before to do activities with each other. Overall, this program was very beneficial to me because I got to improve my communication and leadership skills while also learning about what is going on in the wild.
