<h1>About Me in the Pandemic</h1>

<h2>Pandemic Beginnings</h2>
<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic first started, I was forced to be shut in my home for 3 months. My family was not severely affected by it since my mother would just work at home and my dad was unemployed. My sister and I attended school online and it was mostly humble at home, without much chaos. I developed a few pretty bad habits during my long stay at home. In these months I broke my record for my latest bedtime which now firmly stands at 6:30 AM now. It was strange because I did not even have to commute to school but I still slept later than the times I would during pre-quarantine school days. I started to severely procrastinate since I felt like I had the whole night to myself, not considering the effects of sleep deprivation. I also ended up using my computer for around 14 hours straight every day, only taking breaks to shower and eat. However, I did manage to build a daily routine of consecutive pushups and small workouts for 10 minutes every day for about 3 months. This was probably the healthiest and most positive thing I could have done because I could not engage in any outside exercises during the beginning of the lockdown. School during the start of the quarantine was a disaster. My freshman year that was already going downhill became even worse with the rushed virtual school system. Half my classes did not host virtual classes and gave work through <a href="https://classroom.google.com">google classroom</a> which gave me difficulties since I would normally need context or class before I can do an assignment. I had Spanish every other day which was the worst because we did not cover enough material from the curriculum. My freshman year was mostly stressful and I really hated it because of the way the department of education handled it
