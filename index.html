<h1>Volleyball Summer</h1>
<p>Someday in June, my friends and I decided to go out to Coney Island beach to hang out and play some volleyball. This was the first time we went out and did something as a group together. We were mostly cautious around each other because of our covid awareness at that time. This day stood as a turning point to what I would focus on over the summer. Since I was fairly new to the sport and my friends were experienced, my motivation to play together and improve at the sport rose. Over the summer, we went to the park to practice and play volleyball for a few hours every day. I invested in getting a bike to reduce my commute times and to avoid the bus fair that was going to be rerolled out in September. This was such a great investment because I could exercise with the bike since it took around 20 minutes to bike to the park. I normally spent all of my previous summers in summer programs like SHSAT prep or SAT prep. This was the first time my summer was free like this and I used it to have fun and to improve my overall fitness or health.

<h1>Online Activities</h1>
<p>Aside from playing volleyball every day over the summer, my friends and I also played videogames after our volleyball sessions. Team chemistry was very important in grass volleyball so we did some team bonding by playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a five vs five shooter game. This game relied heavily on teamwork and helped us build stronger friend relationships. Not only did we play FPS based games together, but we also played party games like Mario Party 9 and the Jack Box Party packs to better understand each other and have fun with each other using humor. I also spent time on my own playing a game called osu! where I could improve my hand-eye coordination and my reaction time. Additionally, my parents signed me up for a short 2-week summer program called the Fresh Air Fund where I had to spend 4 hours every day from 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM learning about camping and nature. This program offered a stipend of $500, so I agreed to it since I was mostly playing sports or games over the summer. I hopped on a zoom call to meet new people from NYC that I have never seen before to do activities with each other. Overall, this program was very beneficial to me because I got to improve my communication and leadership skills while also learning about what is going on in the wild.
