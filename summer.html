<h1>About Me in the Pandemic</h1>

<h2>Volleyball Summer</h2>
<p>Someday in June, my friends and I decided to go out to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coney+Island+Beach/@40.5722816,-74.002197,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c24434a1186c45:0x2db95f871281b5b5!8m2!3d40.5721302!4d-73.9793298">Coney Island beach</a> to hang out and play some volleyball. This was the first time we went out and did something as a group together. We were mostly cautious around each other because of our covid awareness at that time. This day stood as a turning point to what I would focus on over the summer. Since I was fairly new to the sport and my friends were experienced, my motivation to play together and improve at the sport rose. Over the summer, we went to the park to practice and play volleyball for a few hours every day. I invested in getting a bike to reduce my commute times and to avoid the bus fair that was going to be rerolled out in September. This was such a great investment because I could exercise with the bike since it took around 20 minutes to bike to the park. I normally spent all of my previous summers in summer programs like SHSAT prep or SAT prep. This was the first time my summer was free like this and I used it to have fun and to improve my overall fitness or health.
